# ColorMe Chrome Extension
Chrome extension that allows articles/pages to have their intended link coloring.

Often when visiting blogs I have previously been on, due to caching, the links are no longer their intended color.
For example, on my blog the intended color is a pink for a link that has not been clicked. When a link is clicked, the
color is turned to a navy color. Often times, due to caching, the color of the link is navy blue.

#### As a quick-fix, I decided to create a chrome extension that:

- Changes all the links to their intended color

<b>The result:</b> All links have their intended coloring regardless of caching.

### Is the extension availale on the Chrome Web Store?
At the moment no, I opted to just upload the code onto GitHub.
